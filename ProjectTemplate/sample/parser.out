Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> body
Rule 1     body -> statement
Rule 2     statement -> expression
Rule 3     statement -> statement CR expression
Rule 4     expression -> H1 factor
Rule 5     expression -> H2 factor
Rule 6     expression -> H3 factor
Rule 7     factor -> TEXT

Terminals, with rules where they appear

CR                   : 3
H1                   : 4
H2                   : 5
H3                   : 6
TEXT                 : 7
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

body                 : 0
expression           : 2 3
factor               : 4 5 6
statement            : 1 3
